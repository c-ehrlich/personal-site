When I started taking this programming thing seriously, I heard one thing over and over: "The best way to learn is to build projects yourself, and to contribute to open source". 

The first part didn't seem so difficult: Learn a new technology and build something with it. Then learn another new technology and build something that uses both of those technologies. Keep going, maybe swapping out some parts of your stack here and there, until you can build a real app that people use. Of course it took a lot of time and effort to get to that point, but the route to get there seemed very clear.

Contributing to Open Source, on the other hand, was not as easy.

TLDR:
1. Use open source projects
2. Find issues
3. Fix them
There's a bit more to it than that, but that's the basic idea.

My first open source contributions were to FreeCodeCamp, while I was still a student myself.
